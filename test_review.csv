review
Its redeeming strength [is] the authentically knotty characters and the performances that inhabit them.
It’s such a heavy-handed approach that The Whale’s extremity risks alienating the audience from the intention.
This was the worst movie I have ever seen.
Aronofsky's career-long obsession with the grotesque is alive and well here and he skirts the edge of exploitation But The Whale is very much a splayed-open tragedy and a weirdly romantic one at that.
